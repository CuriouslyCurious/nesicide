The following items are being tracked here because otherwise they'd be forgotten:

**DONE** 0. Files that have been modified need to have a modification indicator on the tab bar and/or project panel.

1. External modifications of files needs to be tracked and reacted to when NESICIDE gains focus.

**DONE** 2. Add folders to project panel and support loading different file types (headers, etc.)

3. Finish Code Editor lexer for syntax highlights.
   a) It's still a bit buggy with highlighting numbers in label references.
   b) It incorrectly comment-highlights ;'s in "'s.

**DONE** 4. Finish implementation of Code Editor context menu to pull in breakpoint/marker setting and any other context-menu stuff.

5. Customizations for cursor size/color in Code Editor.

**DONE** 6. Changes that effect the display of open Code Editors don't take effect immediately like they should.  It should not require closing/reopening the Code Editor.

7. VIM, perhaps.

8. Add operator highlighting to Code Editor lexer.

9. Arbitrary expressions in the Symbol Watch window.

10. Interactive Lua console for debugging.

11. Add "global persistence" for debuggers so that "most recent settings" can be remembered in a project.

**DONE** 12. GNU Make support as an option alongside direct CA65/LD65 invocation.

**DONE** 13. Figure out why Code Browser doesn't snap to reset vector when project is loaded at application startup, but does when project is loaded after startup.

14. Make clean does not remove .nes or .chr files.

15. Add icons to source navigator and add files to list from project so that files can be shown whether or not they are in the list because they were in the project
or because they were pulled in by the build.

16. Figure out how to adjust lines of errors, breakpoints, and symbol lookups...probably have to do background compilation.

**DONE** 17. Adding multiple files to a project at once.

18. Extend drag-drop capability to allow adding source files (use specified extensions to check) to a project.

**DONE** 19. Project still does not get cleared out properly when a ROM is loaded after a project has been loaded.  Saving the "project" overwrites it with crap.
