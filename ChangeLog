This is the list of changes per version for NESICIDE application.

V1.005
Fixed PPU state-change breakpoints so breakpoints can be set on when the PPU changes state internally (ie. not due to program flow).
Added OAM address/data information to PPU inspector.
Added scroll x/y information to PPU inspector.
Implemented frame step which steps an entire PPU frame.
Added CPU vectors to CPU register inspector.
Enhanced Code Editor syntax highlight and enabled configurable tab spacing, tab/space replacement, and auto-indent (thanks thefox!)
Implemented <ROM>.sav save-state files for saving emulator state.  Right now only the SRAM is restored on a ROM load.
Implemented full-screen mode (F11).
Added support for C files, and C compiler configuration options in Project Preferences.
Initial implementation of FME-7 mapper (69) for thefox.

V1.004
Added search bar hooks to Graphics Bank editor.
Changed auto-completion style of search bar combobox and Search combo boxes to popup instead of inline (nicer).
Added search-and-replace functionality, renamed Find-in-Files to Search since it encompases more than just "find in files" now.
Added support for Vaus Arkanoid controller.
Added function-key shortcuts and menu options for emulator control (play, pause, step cpu, step ppu, reset).
Fixed empty-path problem when creating a new project.

V1.003
Added persistence to options for search widget in toolbar.
Fixed source navigator toolbar widget so symbol selector works--opens file where symbol is found and goes to that line.
Added Ctrl+F hotkey for search toolbar activation, and Ctrl+Shift+F hotkey for Find-in-Files dialog activation.

V1.002
Added Find-in-Files dockable window.
Added current-file search widget to toolbar.
Fixed SVG icon problems--moved to PNG.
Project now accepts any file types and only passes .c or .s files to compiler.
Clicking on marker start/end cells in the Execution Visualizer will show that location in the Assemby Inspector or in the Code Editor if the appropriate source file is open.

V1.001
Fixed problem where non-ASCII keys used for controller configuration were not being mapped correctly.

V1.000
Initial release.
